\chapter[Bot Metrics]{Do bots,  make click, text and behavior metrics irrelevant?}
\section{Abstract}
This article will focus on bot metrics used in E-commerce(social media analytics), as well as bot metrics in other commercial contexts. According to research which will be presented in this article, bots are used in numerous ways, from rigging elections, hiding its own purpose by masquerading as users, to spreading misinformation from unverified sources, to promoting sales as well as working as sales representatives in e-commerce. This article then tries to delve into metrics by looking at social media statistics(SMA) in order to highlight why it may be worthwhile to fool the metrics and further uses a real world example in the case of IMDB reviews in order to give an understanding of how metrics in worst case could influence a buyers' decision. The article is concluded by a discussion on whether or not bot metrics in behavior metrics cause metrics themselves to be irrelevant. 

\section{What are bots and how are they used?}\label{intro:howwhenwhy}
In general, bots are types of software which run automated tasks(which are repetitive and allows for the program to be faster at doing some tasks than what normal humans would be able to. There are many types of bots, for example gaming bots which can be programmed to efficiently react faster than what a human would be able to on certain events in the game, thus making the humans better players. Others examples include auction bots, which hunt for bargains. Ebay went to court in 2000( \cite{Computerworld:Ebay}) in order to stop this type of behavior, the federal courts in turn then decided to block Bidders Edge and their bots from accessing Ebays API.
\\

In the US 2010 mid-term election, social bots were reportedly used to influence the support of some candidates while effectively slandering others by tweeting thounsands of tweets which pointed to websites which contained fake news about the other candidate (\cite{ICWSM112850}). This example highlights the potential seriousness of social bots. \label{midtermElection}
\\
It is not only in elections these bots have a great influence, during the aftermath of the Boston bombings it was noted that social media(and bots) had a great effect on getting the message out there(\cite{Cassa:Twitter}), but there was also a negative effect which bots attributed on Twitter by re-tweeting peoples' unverified accusations or even checking out the credibility of the source, causing more hurt than good. \\
\\
Furthermore bots are used to mimic human activity, in for example service applications which appear to be human interaction but is instead a bot which for example tries to "help" you based on keywords. Bots are used in many areas, but are probably most known for their maliciousness in areas such as spam, bandwidth-thiefs, scrapers, worms and viruses as well as as nodes in a larger scale bot-nets is used for example for DDOS. These bots can be part of bigger bot-nets in order to for example generate revenue through for example click fraud. 
\\
\\
The observers article on fake traffic \cite{Observer:FakeTRAF} describes the problem and its extent: 
\begin{quote}
A recent study by comScore found that 54 percent of display ads shown in thousands of campaigns between May 2012 and February 2013 never appeared in front of a human being. Rather, the traffic came from bots. As an advertiser, this would be like buying a billboard you were told was seen by thousands of cars a day only to find out that was because the billboard sat next to the assembly line at a Ford plant. Sure, that’s a lot of cars, but there’s no one in them.
\\
\\
In fact, the system is so broken that, for some publishers, knowingly buying traffic that comes from bots is part of their business model. An anonymous publishing executive, who claimed to be buying up to \$35,000 worth of traffic per day, recently told Digiday that for publishers running an arbitrage model, all that matters is profit; quality of traffic does not factor into the equation.
\newline

\cite{Observer:FakeTRAF}
\end{quote}

This quote from comScore highlights a important point in today's society. How does click metrics influence us, and how are they used? Are they useless, can they be used to measure something even though results most likely have been contaminated? and how does this type of behavior influence the buyers decision? These and some others are the question I will answer during this chapter. 


\section{What is  social media statistics, and how is it utilized?}\label{intro:howUtilized}
With the rise of social media use, social media marketing got a bigger foothold, allowing marketeers to interact with their buyers to a bigger degree, and it allowed the buyers to interact with their brands. Following this trend, many companies have big social media presences. Social media statistics allows the companies to closely monitor and narrow down their demographic and easily make specific content for a specific demographic. Furthermore, it allows for the company to get free publicity through what is called "organic reach" (getting exposure through users' activity in order to generate more clicks from users' contact) as well as for example paid reach(ads sent to a predefined demographic)
Social media statistics allows for all of this to happen, as \cite{Singh2013} mentions:
\begin{quotation}
Social Media statistics about audience likes and dislikes makes it plausible to employ "push marketing"-techniques to target audiences with advertisements that are relevant to their interests. Also, parameters such as click through rates or CTR can further quantify the success (or failure) of an advertising campaign. 
\end{quotation}
This type of push marketing, utilizes the information the users' themselves have provided to the mother service(e.g. Facebook), like for example metadata which gives a certain characteristic which allows them to be targeted by the broad filters which services like e.g. Facebook uses. 
\\
Businesses also utilizes what is called pull marketing, which is a little more subtle, e.g. referrals, social competitions("like and share" and get the \textit{chance} to win X") these methods can generate traction in social media, and be spread by word of mouth. 
\\
\\
But most notably, these types of metrics can be obfuscated by bots, masquerading as real users. These types of metrics can be abused by bots because bots are hard to detect using convetional statistics and other methods, in an article entitled "Fool Me If You Can: Mimicking Attacks and Anti-Attacks in Cyberspace" \cite{6601602} researchers establish that legitimate cyber behavior can be simulated, and further that it cannot be discriminate mimicking attacks from legitimate cyberevents, in the case of big bot nets. Furthermore, the article concludes that conventional staticial approaches such as viewing time interval and browsing length, can be easily mimicked if this data already exists. This all highlights the problem with bots.


\subsubsection*{An example of why metrics may be come obfuscated}\label{obfuscatedmetrics}
What happens to social media analytics in a business environment when bots enter the fray? Depending on the function of the bot, its behavior can vary greatly. If the bot is what is called a crawler, the bot will crawl through real peoples feed and try to mimic their behavior, and then crawl and gather more data from other people in the first peoples feed and so on. This type of activity has atleast three types of repercussions, it firstly generates fake interest for other companies' social media analytics, it hides their original intention(liking "this page") and it likes "this page" and generates fake revenue and publicity.
\\
\\
\label{Symantec:mockingbirds}A good real-life example is \cite{Symantec:Narang}, which had a set of inter chained accounts posing as real accounts in order to spread their own links about some dubious diet pills. The accounts stole meta data from real accounts. Instead of using compromised
accounts to tweet spam links, they were using accounts that impersonated brands and
celebrities. Symantec goes on to describe how they defined three types of accounts involved in this scam:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\textbf{Mockingbird}: Used real data from real celebrities for impersonating these individuals}
\item{\textbf{Parrot}: Fake accounts using stolen tweets and photographs of real women}
\item{\textbf{Egg}: New users with no set avatar}
\end{itemize}
Mockingbirds have the goal of promoting the weight loss tricks. These mockingbird-tweets would get thousands of likes from Parrot-accounts which spiders through the real accounts of the mockingbirds. Parrots then follow any and everyone in the hope that users will follow them back because they are using avatars of attractive women, a tactic that has proven very efficient. The Parrots have real content that they post each day which is fake, an not only the content of the Mockingbird, in order to seem more real. These tweets are usually stolen from real accounts in order to seem real.  The parrots will also engage in discussions and post "reviews" of the diet pills in order to make the diet pills seem more real while the egg accounts just inflate the like counts in order to make the mockingbirds as well as the parrots seem trustworthy. The egg accounts do not post any content, they just follow parrots.
\\
\\ The link provided by the mockingbirds seem real(with pictures of famous people). When a customer orders a free trial, they register the credit card and subsequently lose their money. 
\\
The point of this example is to show how easily for example likes can be misguiding for a company that tries to establish themselves as a brand within social media. 

\section{Do these metrics influence buyers?}\label{metricInfluence}
As we have seen, metrics can be obfuscated by many different factors; "click farms", bots, and other variables which can affect social media analytics. These factors may present in many different ways. In an article entitled "Beyond likes and tweets: Consumer engagement behavior and movie box office in social media", \cite{Oh2016}, they researched how consumer engagement behavior(CEB) was associated with economic performance based on popular movies released in the US. The study found that CEB in Facebook and YouTube correlated with gross-revenue in opening-week movies. The study further concluded that CEB played a pertinent role in relation to future economic performance, so in some cases pure metrics can have great effects on the consumer itself.

\\\\ Another good example of this is metrics in movies. In particular ratings on movies and Tv-series through IMDB(Internet movie data base), which is used to share users' opinions on films and tv-series in the form of ratings(top 250 movies, bottom 100) as well as recommendations and critics, both professional and user generated. In a paper entitled "Judgement devices and the evaluation of singularities: The use of performance ratings and narrative information to guide film viewer choice"(\cite{Bialecki2016}), the researchers noted that the use of metrics such as ratings(moviegoers set a threshold in which served as a "hurdle" in which movies they wanted to see had to pass). Research also indicated that if a movie had a high rating or were in the top 250 rating-list, it was likely moviegoers would see it because of the ratings themselves. Some subjects noted that the movie did not meet their expectations, but that they had to watch it because of the the ratings:
\begin{quotation}\label{MovieReview}
\textbf{\textit{"}}I rented this movie on the strength of the ratings and glowing
reviews at this site [IMDb]. “Brilliant”,they said. “Dark and beautiful”,
they wrote. 8.4 stars. Well, all I can say is, these people
must have been on some serious drugs when [they] saw this
totally inane movie. . .I give this movie 1 black hole.\textbf{\textit{"}}
\newline \mbox{} \hfill \cite{Bialecki2016}
\end{quotation}


As we can conclude from \cite{Bialecki2016}, we can say that people buy largely based on word of mouth as well as from reviews or "click metrics" (in the form of stars on IMDB). While doing research for this article, I found several websites which both offered botting specifically for IMDB(increase in stars), as well as a direct example of a movie in which had been a "bottom 200-list"-er for a long time, and was considered one of the biggest movieflops, gathering great nominations such as "Worst picture", "worst screen ensamble" \cite{wiki:Oogieloves} as well as a IMDB rating of 2.0 according to a petition\cite{change:Oogieloves}. The petition goes on to describe how the rating of the movie suddenly skyrocketed in June of 2013. in \ref{IMDB:rate} we can see the weighting of votes, most of which are at 10, which is the highest. This seems peculiar given the accolades which the movie was given and the initial score as well as the sudden boom. The ramifications of such actions will be discussed in the discussion part of this paper.

\label{IMDB:rate}
\end{figure}

Another example of research done in this field is an article entitled "The Influence of Social Media: Twitter Usage Pattern during the 2014 Super Bowl Game" which analyzed how people used twitter during the superbowl event specifically looking at consumer interaction with advertisement.
The researchers used data mining in order to find correlations in data which may not be otherwise easily delectable. 
In the article(\cite{HyeonjeongShin2015}), the researchers asked two research questions: "How does the overall number of tweets differ between a game day and non-game day?"\cite{HyeonjeongShin2015}) and "What major topics in commercial related tweets were exchanged during the 2014 superbowl game?"\cite{HyeonjeongShin2015}). The data analysed for research question 1 (How does the overall number of tweets differ between a game day and non-game day?) indicated that Super bowl commercials created a buzz. The research also indicated that tweets about a commercial product accounted for 33\% of total commercial tweets generated on superbowl day(february 2) as opposed to 0.64\% and 9.48\% on january 26 and february 9th. Further, more than half of tweets(37 of 49 tweets) registered mentioned Budweiser products or their commercial. 
\\
\\
Even though these examples do not directly prove that consumers act on these type of data, one can draw the conclusion that user interacting might create a buzz and get your brand out there, thus leading to potentially more customers, subconsciously or otherwise. 

In the case of IMDB-ratings, they seem to influence what movies people want to see, and therefore revenue of movies which are featured in a popular way. This is backed up in a article entitled "An empirical investigation of user and system recommendations in e-commerce" about general statistics with e-commerce metrics \cite{Lin2014111} which could report that:
\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}\label{userreccommendation}
\item {1\% increase in user recommendation volume increases product sales by 0.013\%.}
\item {1\% increase in user recommendation valence increases product sales by 0.022\%.}
\item {1\% increase in system recommendation strength increases product sales by 0.006\%.}
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}
\section{How can the statistics become irrelevant?}
Historically, social media in general has been said to increase globalization as well as further establishing democracy and free flow of information to areas which would otherwise not have this information available. But shortly after the 2016 U.S election, an article entitled "Social bots distort the 2016 U.S. Presidential election online discussion" \cite{Emil:FM7090} discussed how these types of communication tools are used to manipulated the online discussion. The study investigates how social media bots as well as algorithm driven entities appear as legitimate users and how they affect the political election in the 2016 U.S presidential election. In the article, the researchers uses "state-of-the-art" bot detection tools in order to uncover the user population that might not be human. The data collection for this article consisted of two roughly equal lists of hash tags in order to get the most equal coverage of both presidential candidates. \\ \\
The researchers queried the Twitter API every 10 seconds, contioniously and without interuption in three periods between 16th of september as well as 21th of october\cite{Emil:FM7090}. The data they got is listed in table 2 in \cite{Emil:FM7090} and tells us that from the $20,772,153$ tweets gathered, there were $2,782,418$ distinct users. 
\\
\\
For bot detection the researchers used a small Python script(BotorNot) which tested over a thousand features like 
\begin{quote}
"content, network structure, temporal activity, user profile data, and sentiment analysis to produce a score that suggests the likelihood that the inspected account is indeed a social bot."
\cite{Emil:FM7090}

\end{quote}
Further, they found that the two most important revealing factors were metadata as well as user statistics associated with the user account(s). \\
\\
The results are summarized in \cite{Emil:FM7090} table 3. Table 3 shows us statistics for the top $50,000$ accounts BotorNot gave a rating higher than the detection threshold. Table 3 shows us that from the $20,772,153$\cite{Emil:FM7090} tweets, the majority of tweets $10,303,251$ or (\textbf{$81.51\%$})\cite{Emil:FM7090} came from humans, but the remarkable result here is the $2,330,252$ or $18.45\%$ \cite{Emil:FM7090}which came from bots. The researchers used SentiStrength\cite{Emil:FM7090} to detect sentiment. SentiStrength gives a sentiment score, as well as effectively capture positive and negative emotions with up to 70.6\% and 72.8\% \cite{Emil:FM7090} accuracy. 


This allowed for the researchers to indicate the positiveness as well as negativeness of both candidates' tweets. The tweets from Trumps' bot supporters were almost all positive, and  according to SentiStrength were among the most positive of the entire data set, the researchers conclude that this is contradictory to the general negative tone towards which characterizes Trumps 2016 presidential campaign. The researchers further indicate that since the bots are categorically more positive, they can create the sense of a large grassroots following, which in reality are bots posing as humans. 
\\
\\
On the other side, Clinton's human supporters give on average more positive sentiments toward their candidate than what the bots does. The researchers found a more natural distribution of tweet sentiments in both groups which indicated that they were roughly equal both in terms of positive and negative tweets in the pro-Clinton discussion. 
\\
\\
On manual inspection, the researchers analyzed \#nevertrump and \#neverhillary and found that \#nevertrump got $105,906$ \cite{Emil:FM7090}positive tweets and $118,661$\cite{Emil:FM7090}negative tweets, which gave roughly a equal representation of both negative and positive numbers. On the other side, analyzing \#neverhillary found that this hashtag has significantly more negative tweets($204,418$)than positive ($171,877$) \cite{Emil:FM7090} giving a unequal distribution of numbers.
\\
\\

Concluding, the researchers found that there were about $400,000$ bots involved in the political discussion about the presidential election generating aboout $3.8$ million tweets.
Further, the issue of social bots engaged in political discussions poses three more issues. The first issue posed in the conclusion is that social bots may redistribute influence across suspicious accounts which may operate with malicious purposes. The second issue is that the political discussion might be shaped and even polarized by bots by shaping the discussion. The third issue posed is that these bots might spread misinformation as well as unverified information might be spread.




\section{Bot detection}


With nearly 1.13 billion daily active users on Facebook \cite{FB:stats}, the importance of social media and how it influences people is important. As our lives gradually intertwine with social media and a personal digital presence, we become predisposed to marketing from friends and corporations.  But are we humans able to see the difference between what is user generated, or what is generated by bots or similar types of AI?
An article released in 2013, named "Is that a bot running the social media feed? Testing the differences in perceptions of communication quality for a human agent and a bot agent on Twitter"\cite{Edwards2014372} investigated the claim that humans would not see the difference between a bot, and a human in a single newsfeed on Twitter. They used a sample of 240 undergrad students enrolled in a communication course at a large mid-western research university with subjects ranging from the age of 18 to 39 years old. The researchers then used two treatment groups(the twitterbot and the human twitter agent). Those who chose to participate were given a link to a secure webpage with the study. After consenting to the study, the participants were randomly given one of the two twitter pages. The twitter profiles were designed to appear as information provided by the central for disease control(CDC) about sexually transmitted infections. The pages were identical all except for one important detail - the author; in the twitterbot case it was clearly stated that it was a CDC twitterbot, in the other case it was stated that the author was a CDC scientist. The study concluded that
 \begin{quote}
The findings demonstrate that Twitterbots can be viewed as credible, attractive,
competent in communication, and interactional, and might be an
appropriate program to transmit information in the social media
environment. 
\newline \mbox{} \hfill \cite{Edwards2014372}

\end{quote}
An article entitled "Globalization in social media and consumer relationships with brands in digital space" \cite{6959277120111201}, could conclude that 60\% of consumers\cite{6959277120111201} were strong brand advocates, and that they were more likely to buy the brand that they were advocates of. The paper continues to conclude that on a global basis, 18\% of users actively set up their online brand community\cite{6959277120111201}, giving techniques which are explained in \ref{obfuscatedmetrics} a bigger foothold in order to further obscure metrics, and causing marketeers and others who rely on this type of data to have problems.
\section{Discussion}
The question still remains however, are metrics useful when overrun with bots? bots would not really generate revenue for businesses, unless they are used to spread content which lead to for example phishing or other types of attacks, or are used to click adds. The metrics can of course be obfuscated, but in most cases they do not generate value other than maybe increasing awareness of a brand, and as we have learned in \ref{userreccommendation} we know that most people act on user reviews, and that they increase sales. If bots can infiltrate social media successfully and create a credible online personas like what is described in \ref{botrunningfeed}, there could be reason to believe that they could greatly effect how people buy, and what they buy, but not with pure metrics alone. If you can pad the metrics, is that really valuable? One can argue that padding them do not really give any of substance since a following is more valuable if they contribute to your business social media presence, and therefore one would be able to see that most of their large presence is not real, and therefore would not be of any value. 
\\
\\
Another discussion is however how metrics related to adds on web pages which could be harder to detect. Again, the discussion would evolve around how much revenue it would generate other than through pure profit through numbers, but this would most likely not be lucrative in the long run if you discard the initial profit one would get from the first click.
\\
\\
To the discussion on whether or not bots make metrics irrelevant, one needs to first be able to detect that these metrics are generated by bots, research we have presented in this paper might point to that this is not as straight forward as one would think. In \ref{botrunningfeed} we could read that the Twiitterbot was seen as reliable, and trustworthy, this might cause us to believe that advanced bot nets would be very difficult to detect, and one could argue that this type of purposebuilt botnet would be difficult to detect, in fact, if the scenario depicted in Symantecs example is correct, the data would also be correct, allthough not the bots own personality. \ref{Symantec:mockingbirds}


\section{Conclusion}
This article presents some interesting research pertaining to this discussion, in \ref{botrunningfeed} we could read that people were unable to distinguish between bots and humans, and in some cases actually preferred twitterbots, because they found them "credible, attractive, competent and interactional"\cite{Edwards2014372}. In \ref{metricInfluence} we could read about how consumers were basing their decision on what movie to watch by user recommendation and by rating alone, and also \ref{MovieReview} gave an example of how metrics could influence buyers, we could also find somewhat credible sources in \ref{imdbratingCurve} where these metrics were most likely skewed by bots. In the example of \ref{imdbratingCurve} the consequences are probably not that dire, but it could have generated extra revenue because it was highly rated, as depicted in \ref{MovieReview} which it otherwise would not get. But in \ref{midtermElection} it affected a political campaign. Furthermore we can read that globally 18\% of online users act as strong brand advocates, which gives rise to the theory we could read about in \ref{Symantec:mockingbirds} which hides in plain sight by creating a fake persona based on  metadata using a crawling method, making often hard to find bots which hides in plain sight as well as obscuring and creating fake data. One can argue that this problem might be a problem for midsized to large corporations, as small businesses might not have as large of a following as the larger ones, thus being able to detect sudden streams of followers or other type of metrics.
