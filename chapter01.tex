\section{Definition and History of Social Bots} 
This section will introduce the term social bot formally and give a short overview about the history of this topic.

In order to be able to discuss social media bot detection, we need a clear understanding of what social bots actually are.  For that, we use the definition given by Ferrara et al. in their article The Rise of Social Bots:
\begin{quote}
	"A social bot is a computer algorithm that automatically produces content and interacts with humans on social media, trying to emulate and possibly alter their behavior." \cite{ferrara15}
\end{quote}


\section{Why is Bot Detection in Social Media Important?}%Better "Bot-Detection"?
\begin{itemize}
	\item Information flood -> need to get the message through
	\item influence political mood
	\item marketing
\end{itemize}
