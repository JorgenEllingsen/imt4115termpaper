Both personal and corporate computer systems are targets of botnet recruting, but there is several precautions to be taken to reduce the risk of becoming a botnet agent. For organizations, the security measures to be taken is dependenet on many factors  like size, technology and resources avaiable. We recommend a cooperation between the organization and available governmental organizations like CERT' and law enforcement, local providers like ISP's, and international organizations like Europol.

% Summary based on Fabian's contribution - Bot detection
Different approaches can be used to detect social bots, and they can be classified as Social Network Based, Crowd-Sourcing Based and Feature Based. Social Network Based approaches model the relationships between all users, and use the relationships to detect bot users. Crowd-Sourcing on the other hand, uses the social competence of actual humans to decide whether a given user is a bot, and Feature Based approaches use machine learning to detect bot users. All the approaches have its own weaknesses, and a combination is advisable to increase detection rates. It's also important to continiue research since the number of bots is expected to increase and bot creators will continiue to develop more sophisiticated methods to make their bots work undetected.

% Summary based on Audun's contribution - Social Media Attacks on Computers vs Mobile
According to some sources, social media is used in large part from mobile platforms. Reports claim that 79\% of social media usage is on mobile platforms, and still rapidly gaining terrain. In present days it is much safer to use social media on a regular computer rather than on a mobile device, but its still depends to a large degree on user behavior and precaution. The easiest and most commonplace solution for companies today is to omplement a Mobile Device Management System. This will separate the personal content from the work related content, and keep the work related content encrypted. In addition this gives the posibillity to remotly erase data when devices are lost or stolen.
