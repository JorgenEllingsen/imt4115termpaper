However, what happens when this powerful communication tools are exploited to manipulate online discussion, to change the public perception of political entities, or even to try affecting the outcome of political elections? In this study we investigated how the presence of social media bots, algorithmically driven entities that on the surface appear as legitimate users, affect political discussion around the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. By leveraging state-of-the-art social bot detection algorithms, we uncovered a large fraction of user population that may not be human, accounting for a significant portion of generated content (about one-fifth of the entire conversation). We inferred political partisanships from hashtag adoption, for both humans and bots, and studied spatio-temporal communication, political support dynamics, and influence mechanisms by discovering the level of network embeddedness of the bots. Our findings suggest that the presence of social media bots can indeed negatively affect democratic political discussion rather than improving it, which in turn can potentially alter public opinion and endanger the integrity of the Presidential election.},

In the context of the corporate world agility signifies an adaptable, nimble-footed organization re-engineering and refining its operations based on market compulsions to fulfill its strategic goals and objectives. While conventional tools and methodologies are still relevant and form a significant part of the strategic arsenal, newer and evolving avenues such as Social Media offer increasingly proactive and insightful approaches. As businesses strive to stay competitive and customer-centric in their endeavors, Social Media provides a new dimension towards meeting this end through a myriad of approaches, which are examined in this paper.",

Abstract = {The article discusses a Universal McCann (UM) study initiated in 2006 concerning the globalization of social media. The article examines the growth of social networks within social media, particularly around the world. It discusses patterns that have emerged since 2006 in large markets such as the so-called BRIC countries (the U.S., Brazil, Russia, India, and China), and the European Union (EU) so-called Big 5 (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Great Britain). The article examines research concerning profile management of social networks in these countries as well as consumer motivations within social media.},
