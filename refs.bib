abstract="Dictionaries define Agility as quick-moving, nimble, active and so on. In the context of the corporate world agility signifies an adaptable, nimble-footed organization re-engineering and refining its operations based on market compulsions to fulfill its strategic goals and objectives. While conventional tools and methodologies are still relevant and form a significant part of the strategic arsenal, newer and evolving avenues such as Social Media offer increasingly proactive and insightful approaches. As businesses strive to stay competitive and customer-centric in their endeavors, Social Media provides a new dimension towards meeting this end through a myriad of approaches, which are examined in this paper.",

We describe a machine learning framework that combines topological, content-based and crowdsourced features of information diffusion networks on Twitter to detect the early stages of viral spreading of political misinformation.  We present promising preliminary results with better than 96% accuracy in the detection of astroturf content in the run-up to the 2010 U.S. midterm elections.},
